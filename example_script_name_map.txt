# This file will teach you how to write maps for script headers
# At first you must know few things, To comment use "# Your comment here"
# Example:
# This is a comment

# Okay so every map have two parts, first part is the id and the second part is the refactored header
# Those parts are splited  by " = "

# There's two formats for the the second part which is the refactored header

# You can use the first one when only don't need to check for parameter (Skip parameter check), It's formated as follow:
# script_id = script_name
# Without any bracket so our parser would know to skip the parameter check

# The second format is for the rest usage, it can be with parameters or not but it has to be followed by (parameters), for example:
# You got a script with this header "script_556(int arg0, int arg1, String arg2, long arg3)" the refactored header would be
# "some_script_name(int someArgName, int otherArg, int otherArgToo, String strArg, long longArg)"

# Also if the script does not have any parameter use "script_name()" as the refactored header


# 663 = test_with_no_args

# 999 = utils.colors.rgb(int green, int blue, int red)
